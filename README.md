This project is a test of simple GPIO functionality using the Raspberry PI 2/3.

A few buttons and LEDs have been wired as follows (Broadcom port numbering):

Button1 = GPIO26
Button2 = GPIO19
Button3 = GPIO13
LED1    = GPIO20
LED2    = GPIO21

MCP23017 is wired as follows:
SDA     = GPIO2
SCL     = GPIO3
ADR1    = GPIO23
ADR2    = GPIO24
ADR3    = GPIO25
